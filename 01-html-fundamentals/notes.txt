HTML INTRODUCTION
- HTML is used to assemble a webpage out of individual elements like paragraphs, images, links and so on. 
  Elements have their specific tags.
- Element consits of 3 parts: opening tag - <p>; element's content - This is a content; closing tag - </p>.
- If element is empty (like <img> element) closing tag is not used.

BASIC HTML DOCUMENT STRUCTURE
- HTML document always starts with <!DOCTYPE html> to let browser know that we using HTML.
- Then <html> tag is used. Inside it two child tags are created - <head> and <body> (child tags are ones that are inside of another tag).
- <head> tag is used for settings that are not usually rendered on the screen, like language, encoding and so on.
- <body> tag is used for objects that will get rendered, like text blocks, links, images and videos.

TEXT ELEMENTS: PARAGRAPHS AND HEADINGS
- Tags from <h1> to <h6> (stands for 'heading') are used to divide text into logical sections.
- Tags <p> (stands for 'paragraph') are used to display blocks of text. 
- <!-- --> construction is used for commenting the code, making it unusable.
- For improving code readability, it is preferable to divide each <h> tags with all it's <p> tags with \n.
- It is a good practise to have a single <h1> tag on a page, while we can have multiphe <h2> to <h6> tags.
- To make a segment of text bold we use <strong> tag.
- To make a segment of text italic we use <em> tag (stands for 'emphasise').

TEXT ELEMENTS: LISTS
- To make a list, we use <ol> tag (stands for 'ordered list'). Each item of <ol> will have a number before it.
- Another way to make a list is to use <ul> tag (stands for 'unordered list'). It's the same as <ol> except list items will have bullet points instead of numbers.
- Inside <ol> or <ul> tags, we use <li> tags (stands for 'list item') to make indiviual elements of list.
- The main purpose of HTML is to structure all of the content of our webpage by storing different parts of content in their own elements. You can't just paste the text as one big blob, we use HTML to divide it into blocks, so it will be easy to understand and pleasing to look at.

IMAGES AND ATTRRIBUTES
- Attributes are specifications which are used to describe HTML elements. Attributes are usually written inside the openinig tag, for example <img src="link"/> where src is the 'source' attribute that tells the browser where to take from the needed image.
- To add an image to our webpage we need to use <img/> tag. This tag is empty, so we dont use a closing tag. Instead '/' is put at the very end of <img/> tag.
- To link the source if our image we use attribute 'src' (stands for 'source').
- To describe image with text, 'alt' attribute is used. This attribute should always be included, to let blind people understand what is shown in the picture and to let Google search engine understand the content of a picture.
- It's important to add attributes to the <html> tag, such as 'lang'.
- In the <head> tag we need to include the <meta> tag (satnds for 'metadata') in which we add attributes, thath will describe the HTML document, such as 'charset'. Usual charset value is UTF-8.

HYPERLINKS
- Hyperlinks are clickable piecies of text, which willl redirect the user to the other webpage on click.
- To make a hyperlink <a> tag is used (satnds for 'anchor'). Inside the tag we write a piece of text, that will be our hyperlink. It's best to write such text that will reflect the contents of hyperlink.
- In the opening tag of the hyperlink attribute 'href' is used, to specify the url which our hyperlink 
will redirect to.
- Attribute 'target' can be used to open the link in the new tab rather in the same tab. To do this, we set the value of target attribute to ="_blank".
- To make a clickable link that doesn't reffer to anywhere we evaluate href to ="#".

STRUCTURING OUR PAGE
- HTML 5 has a variety of structuring containers which can be used to store different parts of content together in their specific containers. For example, a group of hyperlinks used to navigate the pages of a site can be stored inside of <nav> element (stands fo 'navigation').
- Another widely used structure is <header> tag. Content which is being placed at the very top of the webpage or at the beginning of an article and usually has a specific forms is stored in <header>.
- To store the content that lies athe very bottom of the page <footer> tag is used. It usually stores copyrigth message, phone numbers etc.
- To include different symbols that are not avaliable on the keybord HTML entity is used. 
It syntax is - &entity_name; Each entity has it's unique name, and to find the needed one you may use HTML entity table.

SEMANTIC HTML
- The purpose of semantic HTML is to make elements of the page have a specific meaning behind them, that will be usually reflected in the name of the tag, fo example, for making a piece of text bold we can use both <b> and <strong> tags. But <strong> is preferable since it has a specific meaning and thus making it easier to read and use code in the future.
- The benefits of using semantic HTML: 1. Improved search engine working - Google search engine will understand the contents of the page more clearly thus making our site more accessible. 2. Making the contents of a site more accessible for people that are using screenreaders. 3. Making the code more suitable for future refactoring.

WORKING WITH IMAGES AND HYPERLINKS
- Usually all the images which are used on a webpage are stored in a specific folder like 'img'. To include them into .html document we need to write an relative path to the image inside the 'img' folder.
- To include the information that compliments existent conten, for example, related posts section after an article, we use <aside> container tag.
- Don't forget to add 'alt' attribute to the <img> tag. The short description is suffice.

MAKING A SNEAKER STORE COMPONENT
- Product name, image, price and other qualities should be placed inside an <article> container tag.
- Sincewe making a component of a bigger page, it is beter to use <h2> tags, since <h1> might already be used in the other place of webpage.
