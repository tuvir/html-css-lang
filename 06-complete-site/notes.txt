7 NECCESARY STEPS OF BUILDING A WEBSITE
- 1. Defining the project. It's important to understand to WHO the website is for. Then, for WHAT is for (defining business and user goals for the website). Last, website's target audience should be defined.
- 2. Planning the project. Gather and plan the site content: images, videos and text. Plan the sitemap (if neccesary): which pages does the site need. Based on content, plan the page layout: which sections and in what order does the site need. Finally, define the site personality, based on target audience and content.
- COntent should always guide the design, not the other way around.
- 3. Scetching the layout and components. Think about components you will need for the page and in which layout you're going to place them. Then, scetch the basic framework of the site, using Figma or even pen and paper. Don't overcomplicate the sketches and don't try to make the layout perfect. You can start writing code as soon as you get the general idea, you dont need to finish the sketch.
- 4. Designing the website. Use content, scetches and decisions from previous steps to build the site with HTML and CSS. When you know what components you will need, make the actual visual styles. Use client's colors, logos, etc.
- 5. Test and optimize the website. Test the website in all modern browsers. Test the website on mobile devices. Optimize the size of the images and videos. Fix the accessibility issues, if present,like color-conrast and alt image titles. 
- 6. Launching the site. When the project is finished, upload the files to the hosting platform and choose a domain name, that represents the brand philosophy.
- 7. Maintaining and updating the site. After launching finished project, you need to install analytics software, like Google analytics, based on which you can cahnge the website layout to boost some parameters.
