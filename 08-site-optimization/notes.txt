JAVASCRIPT INTRODUCTION
- To add an automatically changing year element in our site, we use Javascript.

IMPLEMENTING WORKING NAVIGATION AND SMOOTH SCROLLING
- To make buttons lead to certain page parts, we simply give these parts a unique id each and then put that id in the 'href' parameter of a button. This alone wont have the smooth scrolling.
- To make a smooth scrolling animation, we can add CSS property 'scroll-behavior: smooth' to the html element. However, this doesn't work in every browser.

SITE OPTIMIZATION AND TESTING
- To see which browsers support certain propertie, caniuse.com site can be used.
- To analyze the overall perfomance of the site, we use Lighthouse embedded tool in DevTools.
- To compress images we use Squoosh site and Webp image format.
- Webp image form
