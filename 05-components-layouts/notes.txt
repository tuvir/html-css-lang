WEBPAGE BUILDING SYSTEM
- Wehan making a wepage we firrst take individual elements, in which we store our content. Then, we add them together, making components. From individual components we make layouts, based on common layout patterns. Finally, we assemble multiple layouts, to make a webpage.

MAKING AN ACCORDION COMPONENT
- When making space between <li> you can use flexbox, instead of adding margin-bottom. To do that, simply make <ul> a flex container and then set 'flex-direction' to columns. This will rotate the main axis, so it will be facing downwards, thus making the gap property act like a horizontal space between individual <li>
- You can set default line-height in the body. Usually, it's default value is 1.
- Whe you need a shadow that will envelop the item evenly, simply set first two values of 'box-shadow' property to zero.
- When we making a componenet that has several similar elements all of which have some alike states, for exapmple, an accordion component wich has mulriple similar elements, all of which have closed and opened state, it is good to give each state a class and change each state apperance by using it's class.

MAKING A CAROUSEL COMPONENT
- To increase the size of an imag without other elements sizing accordingly, we use 'transform' property with 'scale' function. Yhis is useful, when we need to make the image grow out of the box.
- Sometimes, when the size of element goes bigger than expected, try reducing or increasing the amount of text.
- To easily place any child item in the center of a parent item, we can apply 'flex' to the parent item. This is helpfuw when centerinh icons inside the buttons.
- When absolutely posritioning elements, it's good to use 'transform: translate' property, to adjust the centering more easily.
- When naming state-classes, it's better to give it both the state and the element name, fo example, when we have a dot element with active and passive states, the adtive stete name, should be 'dot-current' rather than 'current'.
- Padding property has a shorthand, with which we can set all 4 side-paddings in one go. The sides go clockwise from top to right to bottom to left.
