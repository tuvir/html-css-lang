WEBDESIGN INTRODUCTION
- The good webdesing is essential to make a website succesful.
- The overall design concept of the site is depended on it's personality, whis is specified by the product/company.

TYPOGRAPHY BASICS
- It's better to choose only the popular typefaces. Sans-serif typefaces are better for begginers, for example, Inter or Roboto.
- Common tools for choosing a typeface are Google fonts and Font squirell.
- It's normal to change the typeface while working on a site to see which one suits better.
- To choose font-size, use type scale tool. For basic text, range from 16px to 32px is fine. For long text, like blogpost, its size should start at 20px. For headlines, use 40px+ and boldness set to 600+.
- For any text, don't go for text under 400.
- For making good reading experience, it's essential to make lines of text no more than 75 chars per line. Also, for normal-sized text, lineheight should vary from 1,5 to 2, for larger text, it should be lower than 1,5.
- You can decrease the letter-spacing in headlines, if it feels unnatural.
- FOr short titltes it might be good to use all-caps.

IMPLEMENTING TYPOGRAPHY
- To add a new font to our web page, we find the needed font on Google Fonts and choose needed weights. Ususally, it's enough to choose 400px, bold, and something in between. Then, we copy the link and add it to the HTML document, int the <head> section, as well as changing the 'font-family' property in our CSS file, adding new font there.

COLOR BASICS
- Tools for working with colors and shades: Open color, Flat UI colors 2.
- To make a good color palette, we ned 2 colors: main color, that represents the site behavior, and 'grey' color, which will be sed for text. Additional colors are velcome, but they need to be carefully picked.
- After making a system of pure colors, we need to make lighter and dareker tones of them, 'tints' and 'shades' respectively. To do that, Tint and Shade generator or Palleton tools can be used.
- For text color, shades of grey are better, since plain black text seems too heavy.
- Better way to write CSS rules for alike elements, is to write common rules in the main class, and diverse rules in the unique subclasses.

WORKING WITH IMAGES
- There are 4 groups of images: product photos, storytelling photos, ilustrations and patterns.
- Free images are avaliable at Unsplash, Pexels, DrawKit and Undraw.
- Three methods of including text on images: 1. Darken or brigthen text area. 2. Place text on a neutral image area. 3. Put text in a box.
- It is always neccesary to compress image files to the maximum, to improve loading time of your website. FOr this, Squoosh tool can be used.
- To make omages placed side by side look good, we need to make sure they have same dimensions or at least same aspect ratio.

WORKING WITH ICONS
- To find good quality icons, sites as Phosphor icons, Ionicons and Icons8 can be used.
- It is important to use one icon pack, to avoid differnt styles of icons. Also, it's neccesary to use svg icons or icon fonts, to avoid pixelating icons.
-When picking icons for a project, it is better to use SVG format of icons.
